SpreadsheetStreams.net
======================

This library is for writing spreadsheets, but not like other spreadsheet manipulating libraries.  
When you are expecting to create huge sheets and prefer low memory usage and performance over random access to cells - this is the solution.
 
Features:
* CSV
* XML (open spreadsheet)
* XLSX
* Support for styling with borders, fills, fonts, number formats, alignment
* Support for merged cells (horizontally and vertically)
* Support for multiple worksheets
* Support for formulas
* Works directly with a stream
* Support .NET Standard 2.0

### Usage

I did not have time to prepare docs, but the library's interface is small and simple.  
One should be able to figure this out from the Sample project included in the code.

## Me
